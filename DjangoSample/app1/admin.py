# TabularInline is used to display and allow editing of related objects directly on the admin page of the parent model. In this case, the ChaiReview model is related to the ChaiVariety model through a foreign key.
# Instead of needing to visit a separate page to add or edit ChaiReview instances, they can be added, edited, or deleted directly on the ChaiVariety admin page.
# The related modelâ€™s data is displayed in a table format (hence the name "TabularInline"). Each row represents a related object (a ChaiReview instance), and each column corresponds to a field in the model.

    # inlines: This is an attribute used in Django's ModelAdmin class to specify related models that should be displayed inline (i.e., within the same form) when editing or adding an instance of the main model.

# The ModelAdmin class is what gives you the ability to configure how your model is managed in the Django admin interface.
# By using it, you can customize the layout, what fields are shown, how they're displayed, which fields can be filtered, searched, etc.
# ModelAdmin enables Control over list display (list_display, list_filter, search_fields, etc.).
class StoreAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('name', 'location')
    filter_horizontal = ('ChaiVarieties',)
    # filter_horizontal: This is an admin-specific setting that provides a better interface for managing many-to-many relationships. 
    # By default, Django admin displays many-to-many relationships with a dual listbox interface (i.e., a pair of select boxes where you move items from one to another).
    # Using filter_horizontal changes this to a widget with a horizontal filter, which makes it easier to select and manage related objects.
